# Hardware Modifications

## M17 support
M17 support on OpenRTX requires a few __hardware modifications__ to be done on your HT,
in this page we describe the modification required for the MD-380 and MD-UV380 and equivalent radios.

__Proceed at your own risk__, if you don't feel comfortable modding your radio, you can ask
a fellow ham to do the mod for you.
