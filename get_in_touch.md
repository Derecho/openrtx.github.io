# Get in touch

## News and updates
We post our latest updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenRtx).

## Community chat
To ask questions or join the discussion you can enter our [Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#openrtx:matrix.org).

You can use Matrix from your browser or your smartphone by using [Element](https://element.io/), or
you can choose another Matrix client from the [client list](https://matrix.org/clients).

After joining the Matrix space we recommend you to __join the channels__ listed in the space that match
your topics of interest.

### Migration from Discord
The OpenRTX community chat was originally hosted on Discord.

We have decided to __migrate the chat gradually away from Discord__, to a [matrix.org](https://matrix.org/) server.

The Discord server and the Matrix space contain the __same channels__ and are __bridged__, so every message
on each of them gets relayed to the other one.

The Discord server __won't be closed soon__ but we consider our Matrix space the __official channel__ and
encourage new and current users to move from Discord to Matrix.

The reasons are the following:
* Matrix.org is based on __Free and Open Source Software__, \
so it's more aligned to OpenRTX ideals.
* We don't want to force our users to register on a proprietary platform,\
Matrix allows self-hosting your own *homeserver*.
* We received an explicit request from [our users](https://github.com/OpenRTX/openrtx.github.io/issues/9).

In case you might need it, here is the Discord server [invite link](https://discord.gg/jZ9t8XTbmd)
