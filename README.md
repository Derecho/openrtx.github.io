# The OpenRTX project

OpenRTX is a free and open source firmware for digital ham radios, top-down designed with modularity, flexibility and performance in mind.

Currently OpenRTX is being actively developed for the following radios:

* Tytera MD-380/390
* Tytera MD-UV380/390
* Tytera TYT MD-9600
* Radioddity GD-77
* Baofeng DM-1801

A detail of the project's current development status is available in [this page](platforms.md).

To run OpenRTX on your device, look at the [users' guide](user_guide.md).

To experiment with OpenRTX or just take a peek under the hood, go to the [developers' page](developers_guide.md).

If you just want to take a look at the code, go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenRTX/OpenRTX).

OpenRTX was created by:

* Niccol√≤ Izzo IU2KIN n@izzo.sh
* Silvano Seva IU2KWO silseva@fastwebnet.it
* Federico Amedeo Izzo IU2NUO federico@izzo.pro
* Frederik Saraci IU2NRO frederik.saraci@gmail.com

All this was made possible by the huge reverse engineering effort of Travis Goodspeed and all the contributors of [md380tools](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools).

A huge thank goes to Roger Clark, and his [OpenGD77](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/OpenGD77) which not only inspired this project, but as a precursor, provided a working code example for the GD77 radio family.

A warm thank you goes to SP5WWP and the [M17](https://m17project.org) community for bringing their libre protocol into our obscure undocumented hardware.

Also thank you for donating hardware to the project:
* M17 Project
* laurivosandi

And thanks to everyone who donated via [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/OpenRTX/donate).
