# MD-380
 
## Device models
- Tytera MD-380(V)(G)
- Tytera MD-390(V)(G)
- Retevis RT3

The suffix "V" denotes the VHF version of a MD-380/390, while its absence denotes an UHF one.  
The suffix "G", instead, denotes the presence of a GPS module.

__Model variants__
- With GPS: with JumpStar JS-H210 module on display/keyboard PCB
- Without GPS: no module footprint present on display/keyboard PCB

### GPIO errata
Here are summarised the differences between the GPIO connections reported on the [schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenRTX/OpenRTX-external-docs/main/Schematics/MD380_UHF_schematic.pdf) of the MD-380 UHF and their real function, obtained by software and hardware reverse engineering.
