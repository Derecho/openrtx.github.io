# MD-9600
 
## Specifications
### Frequency range
* VHF: 136.000-174.000
* UHF: 400.000-480.000

## Hardware components
### Clock tree configuration
To be found

### UI GPIO mapping
* PC6 - display backlight
* PD2 - "P1" button, active low
* PD3 - red "emergency" button, active low
* PD4 - power button, active low
* PE10 - PTT key, active low
* PB10 - encoder
* PB11 - encoder

### Display
The display is a monochrome 128x64 pixel LCD with an ST7567 controller. Command and data are sent through an SPI interface connected to the SPI2 peripheral, shared with the external flash memory. The other GPIOs are:
* PD12 - reset, active low
* PD13 - data/command (A0 on controller datasheet)
* PD14 - chip select, active low

Framebuffer starts at address 0x2001ac08.

Functions identified:
* 0x0804c278 - initialisation routine
* 0x0804c1b8 - send command
* 0x0804c218 - send data
* 0x08025bb0 - clear screen and framebuffer

### HR_C6000
The SPI control interface is connected to the following GPIOs:
* PE2 - chip select
* PE3 - SCK
* PE4 - SDI
* PE5 - SDO

These SPI connections are shared with some other chip, since the firwmare locks a semaphore/mutex before initiating any kind of data transfer through the SPI interface. The semaphore variable is at address 0x2001EC90.

Functions identified:
* 0x080710e6 - software SPI implementation for the control interface
* 0x08071152 - function for sending a data block through the control interface
* 0x08071192 - function to acquire exclusive ownership of the SPI GPIOs and select the HR_C6000
* 0x080711aa - function releasing exclusive ownership of the SPI GPIOs and deselecting the HR_C6000
* 0x08051168 - function for writing to a control RAM register
* 0x08050674 - function where the code for the main HR_C6000 configuration resides.

### External flash memory
The external flash memory for CPS and calibration data storage is a Winbond W25Q128. Data is exchanged through the SPI2 peripheral and chip select seems to be PB12. The SPI bus is shared with the LCD controller and at least another peripheral whose chip select is on PB13.

Functions identified:
* 0x080463fc - function reading a data block from main memory
* 0x08046824 - function reading a data block from a security register
* 0x080464ae - function to acquire exclusive ownership of the SPI GPIOs and select the external flash
* 0x080464d8 - function releasing exclusive ownership of the SPI GPIOs and deselecting the external flash

Calibration data are stored in security registers at addresses 0x1000 and 0x2000 and are loaded into a 512-byte RAM block starting from address 0x2001BE14. The function loading the calibration data from the security registers is at address 0x0802b9c8.
